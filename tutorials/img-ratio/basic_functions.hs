-- Simple exercises

-- reduce input number in half
shrinkWidth :: Double -> Double
shrinkWidth x = x / 2

shrinkHeight :: Double -> Double
shrinkHeight x = x / 2

-- Passing in width and height as a tuple
shrink :: (Double, Double) -> (Double, Double)
shrink (x, y) = (x / 2, y / 2)

-- Passing in in width and height as a list
shrink' :: [Double] -> [Double]
shrink' theList = map (/2) theList

-- Reduce a list of numbers by percentage (i.e. 0.5 for half size) indicated as the 2nd item in a tuple
redux :: ([Double], Double) -> [Double]
redux (theList, percentShrink) = map (*percentShrink) theList

-- Reduce a pair of width/height pair in a tuple, by a given factor, i.e. 0.5
redux' :: Double -> (Double, Double) -> (Double, Double)
redux' factor (x, y) = (x * factor, y * factor)

-- Return calculations at 0.75, 0.5, 0.25 increments
quarters :: (Double, Double) -> [(Double, Double)]
quarters (x, y) = [(x * 0.75, y * 0.75), (x * 0.5, y * 0.5), (x * 0.25, y * 0.25)]

-- Return calculations at 0.10 increments, i.e. 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, etc
tenths :: (Double, Double) -> [(Double, Double)]

-- Return calculations at 0.10 increments, i.e. 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, etc (with recursion to keep it a oneliner)
tenths' :: (Double, Double) -> [(Double, Double)]

How to run this script:

1. Open up ghci in your console and load this file `:l img-ratio.hs` or
   `:load img-ratio.hs`. :l is short for :load.

2. Call one of the defined functions, i.e. `shrinkWidth 1024` will return
   the value of 1024 divided by 2; the output will be 512.0.

   Note the data types in the function to understand correct input for
   each method. For instance, shrinkWidth takes a Double type, so passing
   in a string such as `blue` will produce an error "Not in scope: `blue'".
   Similarly, for shrink' (pronounced shrink prime), this function takes a list of
   Doubles. Passing in a different type, such as a tuple
     `shrink' (1024, 768)`,  will give you an error:
   Couldn't match expected type `[Double]' with actual type `(t0, t1)'
      - In the first argument of shrink', namely `(1024, 768)'
      - In the expression: shrink' (1024, 768)
      - In an equation for `it': it = shrink' (1024, 768)

    Another example of wrong input - passing in a list of strings:
       > `shrink' ["red", "white", "blue"]`
       Couldn't match expected type `Double' with actual type `[Char]'
       In the expression: "red"
       In the first argument of shrink', namely `["red", "white", "blue"]'
       In the expression: shrink' ["red", "white", "blue"]
